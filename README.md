# Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-Disaster

Hello everyone. Here is my code for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. Please note that some code has been reused from other people's kernels. I will be editing the document to give credit where necessary. To view the jupyter notebook please visit [Titanic: Machine Learning From Disaster Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brodyu/Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-Disaster/blob/master/titanic.ipynb)

NOTE: There is a ongoing problem with viewing uploaded python notebooks on GitHub. Until Git fixes this issue please use the link above to view my kernel. Nbviwer is a web application that renders the URL of a jupyter notebook file.
